## Usage Notes
### Usage Without the Backend API
If you want to only use the React App without the Rails-Backend API, you will need to populate the state with the appropriate information.  Since the state is only getting passed down once, you don't need to modify it anywhere else.

If you decide to use the Backend API, follow the quick steps in the Backend API's repo to get started.  Do not modify the original state, as it will be needed for the page to render properly.
